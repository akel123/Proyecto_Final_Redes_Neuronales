\section{Conclusión/Discusión}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Networks do seem to be sensitive to higher frecuencies
    \item noise adds high frequency to image (but it's such low intensity...)
    \item JPEG defense has some effect with both data we tested
    \item JPEG defense doesn't really change the transfer function much
    \item The attacks are more effective with the color pictures, but JPEG defense is more effective as well
    \item seems like more pixels allow for smaller epsilons and less obvious attacks. (also I know this is mentioned in an article somewhere)
\end{itemize}
