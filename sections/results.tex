\subsection{Â¿Que hace la defensa JPEG?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show graphs of jpeg defense vs epsilon of each attack 
    \item over parameterization and overfitting contributing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item here they suggest overparameterization contributes to sharp gradient landscape \cite{ma2020understanding}...we find the opposite
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item try overparameterization
            \item try overfitting 
            \item fix a large overparameterization and see if overfitting has the same effect
            \item pick an overparameterization and overfitting and check jpeg
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Saliency
    \begin{itemize}
        \item show figures from notebook of how adversarial noise attacks parts of the image that seem vulnerable (for example changing a 3$\to$8)
        \item Show Gradient-based localization of both imiage sets and how they change after adding adversarial noise\cite{Selvaraju_2019}
    \end{itemize}
