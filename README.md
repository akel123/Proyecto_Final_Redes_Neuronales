# Proyecto_Final_Redes_Neuronales

Final Project of 2021 Winter Semester Neural Networks class at UNAM by Aaron Kelley and Rodrigo Fritz. Code to generate figures not included, but maybe one day if I organize it and/or there is interest in seeing it.

Github can't display the pdf (probably because it has some animations), but just download it if you want to read it: [main.pdf](https://github.com/akel123/Proyecto_Final_Redes_Neuronales/raw/master/main.pdf). To see the animations you need to open it with Adobe Acrobat
